This study explored whether individualsâ€™ subjective (perceived socioeconomic status) and objective (education background) social class statuses were associated with different types of values (self- vs. other-related) that people considered important in their lives. Using text data that participants used to describe their core values, we also characterized value-related languages used by individuals from different educational backgrounds.
